# linear-regression
This project includes methods to fit a linear model using an OLS cost function and a LAD cost function. It fits the linear model using both cost functions to a data set representing the miles-per-gallon of 398 cars given other variables describing them. It then fits the data using Scikit-Learn.

## Run project
* Download linear_regression.ipynb and car_data.csv
* Put both of the files in the same folder
* Open linear_regression in Jupyter Notebook
